## Contact form with SvelteKit and Nodemailer

A contact form that sends the form data to any mail you specify.

```bash
# create a new project in the current directory
git clone https://github.com/Alxlol/contact-form

# install dependencies
npm install

# you need to provide an email + password (where the form will be sent too and from)
# either create a .env file and provide it with the required information or just fill it out manually in the +page.server.ts file

# run dev server
npm run dev -- --open
```
